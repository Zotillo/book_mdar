# Communities

None of this would be possible without the help of the fantastic communities around these open source projects so instead of being tucked away in the appendix here is how to get involved with them.

## Websites

These are the first places to go for help, check out the documentation and see if you can find your answer there.

* [http://merbivore.com/](http://merbivore.com/)
* [http://datamapper.org/](http://datamapper.org/)
* [http://rspec.info/](http://rspec.info/)

## IRC Channels - freenode.net

If you can't find what you were looking for in the APIs then you could join the respective IRC channel on FreeNode and ask your question in there. 

* [#merb](irc://irc.freenode.net/merb)
* [#datamapper](irc://irc.freenode.net/datamapper)
* [#rspec](irc://irc.freenode.net/rspec)

## Mailing Lists

The mailing lists are another good way to get help, the response time isn't as fast as asking in an irc channel but it can be useful to do a search to see if someone else has had your problem before.

* [http://groups.google.com/group/merb/](http://groups.google.com/group/merb/)
* [http://groups.google.com/group/datamapper/](http://groups.google.com/group/datamapper/)
* [http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rspec-users/](http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rspec-users/)

## Bug Trackers

Your problem may or may not be a known bug, search the bug trackers and submit a ticket if its not there already (don't forget to include a description and test cases, or better yet: a patch!).
