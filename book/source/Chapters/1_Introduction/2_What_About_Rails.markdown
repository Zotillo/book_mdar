# What About Ruby On Rails?

> [Merb is] Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, to quote Daft Punk - Max Williams

So what's the big deal? We have Ruby on Rails and that's enough, isn't it? There is little doubt that Ruby on Rails has rocked the web application development world. You have to give credit where credit's due, but it can be unforgiving if you don't want to do things 'the Rails way'.
 
Where Rails is opinionated, Merb is agnostic. You can easily use your favourite ORM (ActiveRecord, DataMapper, Sequel) or none at all, and choose the Javascript library and template language.

Merb also has super-fast routing and is thread-safe (If performant were a word, Merb would be it). The core functionality is kept separate from the other plugins and it uses less Ruby 'magic', which makes it easy to understand and hack.

Rails (and consequently Ruby) has received a lot of criticism for not being suitable for large scale web applications, which isn't necessarily true. Merb has been built from the outset to prove that Ruby is a viable language for building fast and scaleable web applications.

At the end of the day it's about choice. There are many new Ruby frameworks springing up, undoubtedly helped by the success of Rails, but in my opinion Merb shows the most promise as a Rails competitor.
