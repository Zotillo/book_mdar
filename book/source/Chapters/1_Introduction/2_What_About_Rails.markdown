## What About Ruby On Rails?

> [Merb is] Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, to quote Daft Punk - Max Williams

So what's the big deal? We have Ruby on Rails and that's enough, isn't it? 
There is little doubt that Ruby on Rails has rocked the web application 
development world. You have to give credit where credit's due, and Ruby on Rails 
is definitely a great web framework.  However, there is no such thing as a 
one-size fits all solution.  Ruby on Rails is opinionated software which 
provides many benefits such as Convention over Configuration.  On the other 
hand, this also means that Ruby on Rails can be unforgiving if you don't want 
to do things 'the Rails way'.
 
Where Rails is opinionated, Merb is agnostic. For example, you can easily use 
your favourite ORM (ActiveRecord, DataMapper, Sequel) or none at all.  
Similarly, you can choose the Javascript library and template language that you 
are most comfortable with, or that best meets the requirements of your specific 
project.

If performant were a word, Merb would be it.  One of Merb's design mantras is 
"No code is faster than no code".  Merb has super-fast routing and is 
thread-safe. The core functionality is kept separate from the other plugins 
and it uses less Ruby 'magic', making it easier to understand and hack.

Rails (and consequently Ruby) has received a lot of criticism for not being 
suitable for large scale web applications, which isn't necessarily true. Merb 
has been built from the outset to prove that Ruby is a viable language for 
building fast and scaleable web applications.

At the end of the day it's about choice. There are many new Ruby frameworks 
springing up, undoubtedly encouraged by the success of Rails.  In our opinion,
Merb shows the most promise of these.
