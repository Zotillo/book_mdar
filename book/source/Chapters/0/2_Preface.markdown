## Preface

This is a collaborative effort to document the features of Merb and DataMapper, 
while also providing example Merb applications.  

___Who is this for?___

The target reader is someone who has some experience with writing Ruby on Rails 
applications, and is looking to try out a new framework. So if your looking for 
the [AWDR](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/rails2) equivalent for Merb, you may 
be disappointed as this is a work in progress.
