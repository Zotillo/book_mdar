<h1>Life On The Edge With Merb, DataMapper &amp; RSpec</h1>

<h1>Forward</h1>

<p>(TODO) the forward</p>

<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>At New Bamboo we've been building our internal applications in Merb for quite some time now. This is a collaborative effort to document the features of Merb and DataMapper, while also providing an example Merb application.  </p>

<p><strong><em>Who is this for?</strong></em></p>

<p>The target reader is someone who has some experience with writing Ruby on Rails applications, and is looking to try out a new framework. So if your looking for the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/rails2">AWDR</a> equivalent for Merb, you may be disappointed as not all topics will be covered.</p>

<h1>What is Merb, DataMapper &amp; RSpec?</h1>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you're not living on the edge, you're taking up too much room. - Alice Bartlett</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Merb (Mongrel + ERB), DataMapper and RSpec are all open source projects, which can be used for building kick-ass web applications. As they are in active development, it can be hard to keep up, but we'll try our best to keep up to date.</p>

<h2>Merb</h2>

<p>Merb is a bit like Ruby on Rails, as they both are frameworks for building web applications. It's a relatively new framework and was created by <a href="http://brainspl.at/">Ezra Zygmuntowicz</a>.</p>

<p>If you know Ruby and have used Rails you're likely to get the hang of Merb quite easily. Where Merb differs the most from Rails is it's approach to modularisation, it's not tied down to a particular ORM for example so you can use any one you wish.</p>

<p>This means the core of Merb is simple with additional functionality provided by plugins (gems).</p>

<p>Merb is actually made up of two gems, merb-core and merb-more. This is so you can pick and choose the functionality you need, the gem merb installs both merb-core and merb-more so you can get started straight away.</p>

<p>You might be wondering what's the benefit of this? Well merb-core can be used as an upload server, provide an api or as simple web app (a la <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/camping/">camping</a>) where the functionality of a fully fledged framework isn't necessary. It also supports the <a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org/">rack webserver interface</a> so you can use any web server that has rack support (mongrel, thin, etc.) </p>

<h2>Datamapper</h2>

<p>DataMapper is a Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) written in Ruby, created by Sam Smoot and is what we'll be using with Merb, you could use the same ORM Rails uses (ActiveRecord), but as there are plenty of examples of using ActiveRecord already I've chosen to use DataMapper.</p>

<p>It has some nice features which makes it faster than ActiveRecord in some cases, but what really stands out for me is the way it handles database attributes. The schema, migrations and attributes are all defined in one place, your model. So you no longer have to look around in your database or other files to see what is defined.</p>

<p>DataMapper has some similarities with ActiveRecord but we will highlight the differences as we go along.</p>

<h2>RSpec</h2>

<p>(TODO) intro to RSpec</p>

<h1>What About Ruby On Rails?</h1>

<blockquote>
    <p>[Merb is] Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, to quote Daft Punk - Max Williams</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what's the big deal, we have Ruby on Rails and that's enough isn't it? There is little to no doubt that Ruby on Rails has rocked the web application development world. You have to give credit where credit's due, but it can be unforgiving if you don't want to do things 'the Rails way'.</p>

<p>Where Rails is opinionated, Merb is agonistic. You can easily use your favourite ORM (ActiveRecord, DataMapper, Sequel, etc.), Javascript Library and template language.</p>

<p>Merb also has super-fast routing and is thread-safe (If performant were a word, Merb would be it). The core functionality is kept separate from the other plugins and it uses less Ruby 'magic', which makes it easy to understand.</p>

<p>Rails has received a lot of criticism for not being suitable for large scale web applications, which isn't necessarily true, but the Merb development team has set out to prove that Ruby is a viable language for building fast and scaleable web applications.</p>

<p>At the end of the day it's about choice, there are many new Ruby frameworks springing up, undoubtedly helped by the success of Rails, but in my opinion Merb shows the most promise.</p>

<p>If you'd like to take a look at some other frameworks these links should get you started:</p>

<ul>
<li>http://camping.rubyforge.org/files/README.html</li>
<li>http://www.nitroproject.org/ </li>
<li>http://ramaze.rubyforge.org/</li>
<li>http://sinatra.rubyforge.org/</li>
<li>http://halcyon.rubyforge.org/</li>
<li>http://wisteria.swiftcore.org/</li>
</ul>

<h1>Communities</h1>

<p>None of this would be possible without the help of the fantastic communities around these open source projects so instead of being tucked away in the appendix here is how to get involved with them.</p>

<h2>Websites</h2>

<p>These are the first places to go for help, check out the apis and see if you can find your answer there.</p>

<ul>
<li>http://merbivore.com/</li>
<li>http://datamapper.org/</li>
<li>http://rspec.info/</li>
</ul>

<h2>IRC Channels - freenode.net</h2>

<p>If you can't find what you were looking for in the apis then you could join the respective irc channel and ask your question in there. </p>

<ul>
<li>#merb</li>
<li>#datamapper</li>
<li>#rspec</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mailing Lists</h2>

<p>The mailing lists are another good way to get help, the response time isn't as fast as asking in an irc channel but it can be useful to do a search to see if someone else has had your problem before.</p>

<ul>
<li>http://groups.google.com/group/merb/</li>
<li>http://groups.google.com/group/datamapper/</li>
<li>http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rspec-users/</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug Trackers</h2>

<p>Your problem may or may not be a known bug, search the bug trackers and submit a ticket if its not there already (don't forget to include a description and test cases - even better a patch!).</p>

<ul>
<li>http://merb.devjavu.com/</li>
<li>http://wm.lighthouseapp.com/projects/4819-datamapper/overview</li>
<li>http://rspec.lighthouseapp.com/</li>
</ul>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>Before we get started I'm going to assume you have the following installed:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> </li>
<li>A DBMS (we'll use <a href="http://mysql.org/">MySQL</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">SVN</a> and <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a> (if you want to get the source code)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installing Merb</h2>

<p>If you just want to play around with Merb grab the gem:</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem install merb -y
</code></pre>

<p><em>Windows users see <a href="http://www.ghostonthird.com/2007/11/17/merb-on-windows-it-works/">this post</a> for the install instructions.</em></p>

<p>On the other hand if you want to get down and dirty it's best to grab the source code from trunk 
and you'll need to install the following gems:</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem install mongrel json_pure erubis mime-types rspec hpricot \
    mocha rubigen haml markaby mailfactory ruby2ruby -y

(TODO) - git repo for merb trunk 
svn co http://svn.devjavu.com/merb/trunk merb &amp;&amp; cd merb &amp;&amp; rake install
</code></pre>

<p>Take note that if you need to use JSON you should install the json gem, json_pure is used so merb will install on JRuby.</p>

<p>Merb is ORM agnostic, but as the title of this book suggests we'll be using Datamapper.
Should you want to stick with ActiveRecord or play with Sequel, check the <a href="http://merb.rubyforge.org/files/README.html">merb documentation</a> for install instructions.</p>

<h2>Installing Datamapper</h2>

<pre><code>sudo gem install merb_datamapper
sudo gem install data_objects
sudo gem install do_mysql || do_sqlite3 || do_postgres
</code></pre>

<p>You need to install the correct database adaptor for the database you are using. I'll use MySQL, 
but you can use any of the above. If you get the following error message, 'Cannot find mysql_config in 
your path', then you need to add your MySQL bin directory to your path or you can run this is the command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo env PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH gem install pkg/ 
do_mysql-0.2.2.gem -- --with-mysql-dir=/usr/local/mysql

# If updating the gem:
sudo env PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH gem update do_mysql -- \
    --with-mysql-dir=/usr/local/mysql
</code></pre>

<h2>Install RSpec</h2>

<p>To install the gem, or get the source from trunk:</p>

<pre><code>gem install rspec
svn checkout http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk rspec_trunk
</code></pre>

<h1>Creating an App</h1>

<p>Right now that we've got all of that installed, time to create some test Merb application. Merb follows the same naming convention for projects that rails does, so 'my_test_app' and 'Test2' for example are valid names but 'T 3' is not, as they need to be valid SQL table names.</p>

<p>I like to keep my projects in different directories, so I have a different folder for my Merb apps and 
Rails apps (but it's up to you). So at the command line type:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir merb
cd merb
merb example_one
</code></pre>

<p>This will generate an empty Merb app, so lets go in and take a look. You'll notice that the directory structure is similar to Rails, with a few differences.</p>

<pre><code># expected output
create  
create  app/controllers
create  app/models
create  app/helpers
create  app/mailers/helpers
create  app/mailers/views/layout
create  app/parts/helpers
create  app/parts/views/layout
create  app/views/layout
create  app/views/exceptions
create  config/environments

create  spec/spec_helper.rb
create  test/test_helper.rb
create  config/merb.yml
create  script/stop_merb
create  script/generate
create  script/destroy
</code></pre>

<h2>Configuring Merb</h2>

<p>Right so lets try and get the server running, before we do that you'll need to edit the dependencies.rb 
file so un-comment the following lines (this is only necessary if you need to connect to a database):</p>

<p>config/dependencies.rb</p>

<pre><code>use_orm :data_mapper

use_test :rspec

dependencies "RedCloth", "merb_helpers"
</code></pre>

<p>Typing merb now in your command line will try and start the server.</p>

<pre><code>Started merb_init.rb ...
No database.yml file found in /Users/work/merb/t/example_one/config.
A sample file was created called database.sample.yml for you to copy and edit.
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we forgot to set up the database. A sample file has kindly been generated for us. 
So create a database.yml file a bit like this one (remember to create the database you specify):</p>

<pre><code># This is a sample database file for the DataMapper ORM
:development:
  :adapter: mysql
  :database: test
  :username: root
  :password: 
  :host: localhost
</code></pre>

<p>Starting merb again shows everything is running ok:</p>

<pre><code>Merb started with these options:
--- 
:exception_details: true
:query_string_whitelist: []

:port: "4000"
:environment: development
:session_secret_key: /USERS/WORK/BOOK/MERB_BOOK/CODE/EXAMPLE_ONE2400
:reloader_time: 0.5
:host: 0.0.0.0
:mongrel_x_sendfile: true
:reloader: true
:cache_templates: false
:use_mutex: true
:merb_root: /Users/work/book/merb_book/code/example_one
:session_id_cookie_only: true

Started merb_init.rb ...
Connecting to database...
Loading Application...
Compiling routes..
Loaded DEVELOPMENT Environment...
Not Using Sessions
</code></pre>

<p>You'll notice Merb runs on port 4000, but this can be changed with flag -p [port number]. More options can be found by typing:</p>

<pre><code>merb --help
</code></pre>

<h1>The Framework</h1>

<p>Lets take a closer look at the directory structure that we've just created. I'll give brief overview of the framework here and go into further details of each component in subsequent chapters.</p>

<p>(TODO) - book:publish to add image
<img src="dir.jpg" alt="Directory Stucture"/></p>

<p>The app folder contains your usual Models, Views and Controllers, Helpers. It also has Parts (they inherit from AbstractController), similar to the old Rails components, but are lightweight and are useful for sidebars, widgets etc. Mailers (which also inherit from the AbstractController) have their own folder where the controllers and views live. </p>

<pre><code>app
  |--- controllers
  |--- models
  |--- helpers
  |--- mailers
  |--- helpers
  |--- parts
  |--- views
</code></pre>

<p>The config folder has all the configuration files and environments. It's important to edit the following files in here, dependencies.rb and database.yml before running Merb. The Merb router is defined here too, which map the incoming requests to the controllers (the syntax is not the same as Rails). </p>

<pre><code>config
     \--- environments
</code></pre>

<p>Lib Folder contains extra stuff, not necessarily loaded on boot, need to add to dependencies. </p>

<p>(TODO) - better lib desc, loading files etc</p>

<pre><code>lib
</code></pre>

<p>The Log directory contains logs, process id's.</p>

<pre><code>log
</code></pre>

<p>Public will hold all your assets, just like rails. </p>

<pre><code>public
      \--- images
      \--- javascripts
      \--- stylesheets
</code></pre>

<p>Script contains the generators and scripts. Run script/generate --help to see what generators you have available. </p>

<pre><code>script
</code></pre>

<p>Spec is for RSpec tests.</p>

<pre><code>spec
    \--- models
    \--- controllers
</code></pre>

<p>Test is for test/unit (same as Rails)</p>

<pre><code>test
    \--- unit
</code></pre>

<p>Gem is there so you can package gems with your application, as plug-ins are gems </p>

<pre><code>gems
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike Rails there is no db, doc or vendor directory when generating an empty app.</p>

<h1>A little blog</h1>

<p>In the examples we'll be developing a small blogging application. It's a good idea to grab the source code from 
(TODO) -location, so you can follow along with the examples.</p>

<p>First of all let's define some of the functionality we would expect from any blogging application. </p>

<ul>
<li>Publishing posts</li>
<li>Leaving comments</li>
<li>Sending email notifications</li>
<li>Attaching images</li>
<li>Authentication</li>
</ul>

<p>Lets get started with out application:</p>

<pre><code>merb simple_blog
</code></pre>

<p>We're going to use the Linguistics gem so you'll need to install it.
(TODO) - linguistics gem install</p>

<p>Set up the configuration files as before:</p>

<p>config/dependencies.rb</p>

<pre><code>use_orm :data_mapper

use_test :rspec

dependencies "RedCloth", "merb_helpers"
dependencies 'linguistics'
</code></pre>

<p>Now add a config/database.yml file with the following:</p>

<pre><code>---
:development: &amp;defaults
  :adapter: mysql
  :database: simple_blog
  :username: root
  :password: 
  :host: localhost

:test:
  &lt;&lt;: *defaults
  :database: simple_blog_test

:production:
  &lt;&lt;: *defaults
  :database: simple_blog_production
</code></pre>

<p>Now we're ready to rock and roll ...</p>

<h2>Models</h2>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>Having discussed the functionality we can deduce that we will need the following models, Post, Comment, Tag, User and Image.</p>

<p>Merb has a model generator just as rails does:</p>

<pre><code>script/generate model post
</code></pre>

<p>This is make a post model for you, provided that you have defined an orm and the database simple_blog, in the previous steps.</p>

<p>When you run rake dm:db:auto_migrate, it will create the database table and all the properties, but take care this is a destructive method!</p>

<p>You can set the name of the database table in your model if it is called something different with:</p>

<pre><code>set_table_name 'list_of_posts'
</code></pre>

<p>This is only necessary if you are using an already existing database.</p>

<h4>Properties</h4>

<p>So DM models differ a bit from AR models as previously stated. Defining the database columns is achieved with the property method.</p>

<p>app/models/post.rb</p>

<pre><code>property :title,      :string,    :lazy =&gt; false
</code></pre>

<p>This is the title property of the post model. As we can see, the parameters are the name of the table column followed by the type and finally the options. </p>

<p>Some of the available options are:</p>

<pre><code>:lazy         - Lazy load the specified property (:lazy =&gt; true).
:default      - Specifies the default value
:column       - Specifies the table column
:nullable     - Can the value be null?
:key          - Set as primary key
:index        - Creates a database index for the column
:accessor     - Set method visibility for the property accessors. Affects both
                reader and writer. Allowable values are :public, :protected, :private.
:reader       - Like the accessor option but affects only the property reader.
:writer       - Like the accessor option but affects only the property writer.
:protected    - Alias for :reader =&gt; :public, :writer =&gt; :protected
:private      - Alias for :reader =&gt; :public, :writer =&gt; :private
</code></pre>

<h4>Associations</h4>

<p>Like AR, DM has associations which define relationships between models. Continuing with the Post model we can see a few of the associations defined:</p>

<pre><code>has_many :comments
belongs_to :author, :class =&gt; 'User', :foreign_key =&gt; 'author_id'
</code></pre>

<p>You also can have the associations, has_one and has_and_belongs_to_many (where you can specify the :join_table).</p>

<p>Pretty straight forward. A few things you should note however, you do not need to specify the foreign key as a property if it's defined in the association, and currently has_one is implemented as has_many (so it returns an array with one object instead of just the object itself, but this is will likely change!).</p>

<p>You also don't have to specify a relationship at all if you don't want to, as models can have one way relationships.</p>

<h5>Polymorphic associations</h5>

<p>http://pastie.textmate.org/private/mrvx3qmuagypwukrri9jq
(TODO) -polly assoc</p>

<h5>Where is my has_many :through?!</h5>

<h3>CRUD</h3>

<p>(TODO) -CRUD</p>

<h4>Creating</h4>

<p>To create a new record, just call the method new on a model and pass it your attributes.</p>

<pre><code>@post = Post.new(:title =&gt; 'My first post')
</code></pre>

<p>There is also an AR like method to find_or_create which attempts to find an object with the attributes provided, and creates the object if it cannot find it.</p>

<p>There is another way to create an object, which is to save it after the attributes have been set like this:</p>

<pre><code>@post = Post.new
@post.attributes = {:name =&gt; 'Hi!',:body =&gt; 'This is just awesome!'}
@post.save
</code></pre>

<h4>Reading (aka finding)</h4>

<p>The syntax for retrieving data from the database is clean an simple. As you can see with the following examples.</p>

<p>Finding a post with one as its primary key is done with the following:</p>

<pre><code>Post[1]
</code></pre>

<p>To get an array of all the records for the post model:</p>

<pre><code>Post.all
</code></pre>

<p><em>NOTE</em>: you can also do Post.find(:all), like the AR syntax but this is just a synonym for Post.all</p>

<p>To get the first post, with the condition author = 'Matt':</p>

<pre><code>Post.first(:author =&gt; 'Matt')
</code></pre>

<p>When retrieving data the following parameters can be used:</p>

<pre><code>#   Posts.all :order =&gt; 'created_at desc'              # =&gt; ORDER BY created_at desc
#   Posts.all :limit =&gt; 10                             # =&gt; LIMIT 10
#   Posts.all :offset =&gt; 100                           # =&gt; OFFSET 100
#   Posts.all :include =&gt; [:comments]
</code></pre>

<p>If the parameters are not found in these conditions it is assumed to be an attribute of the object.</p>

<p>You can also use symbol operators with the find to specify a condition, for example:</p>

<pre><code>Posts.all :title.like =&gt; '%welcome%', :created_at.lt =&gt; Time.now
</code></pre>

<p>This would return all the posts, where the tile was like 'welcome' and was created in the past.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the valid operators:</p>

<ul>
<li>gt    - greater than</li>
<li>lt    - less than</li>
<li>gte   - greater than or equal</li>
<li>lte   - less than or equal</li>
<li>not   - not equal</li>
<li>like  - like</li>
<li>in    - will be used automatically when an array is passed in as an argument</li>
</ul>

<p>If you require a custom find, you can use sql with the method, find_by_sql. This will return an array of Structs (which are read-only) with the result of the query. </p>

<h5>Count</h5>

<p>DM provides a count method to count the number of records of a model, you can also pass search conditions to count:</p>

<pre><code>comment_count = Post[1].comments.count
</code></pre>

<h5>Each</h5>

<p>(TODO) - Each</p>

<p>DataMapper sports an incredibly powerful each method with safely iterates over large quantities of rows in a table performing the block you pass in. Think of it like a Animal.find(:all).each {} block, but so much easier on your resources. Rather than instantiating all objects and then iterating over them, each works in batches and only instantiates a batch of results at a time, then iterates over items in the batch. Notice how you can pass it options just like a finder.</p>

<pre><code>1 Animal.each(:species =&gt; 'Mammal').each do |a|
2   a.reproduce!
3 end
</code></pre>

<h4>Updating</h4>

<pre><code>1 zoo.update_attributes(:name =&gt; 'Funky Town Municipal Zoo')
</code></pre>

<p>(TODO) - updating attributes
(TODO) - Dirty? only updates the changed attributes, so take note for virtual attrs</p>

<h4>Destroying</h4>

<p>You can destroy database records with the method destroy!, this work much like AR.</p>

<pre><code>bad_comment = Comment[6]
bad_comment.destroy!
</code></pre>

<p>Should you want to delete all the records of a model, you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>Comment.delete_all
</code></pre>

<pre><code>partial :post, {:comments =&gt; @post.comments}
</code></pre>

<p>To display the latest posts on our blog's front page, we use the :with and :as arguments to render a collection.</p>

<h1>RSpec</h1>

<p>When using stubs with RSpec you can roughly categorise the methods you are going to use into two categories. On one side you have the sub! and should_receive methods which refine what methods you expect to be called with what parameters and potentially what they should return in the case of the test being run. On the other side you have assertions which test the output and value or variables. The should method is primarily used when asserting things.</p>

<p>(TODO) - How to spec models, use example merb/dm test talk through them, mocking</p>

<h2>Spec'ing Views</h2>

<p>(TODO) - What they should test</p>

<h2>Spec'ing Controllers</h2>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>Testing controllers typically involves stubbing out some methods, making a fake request and then ensuring the right variables are assigned, exceptions are raised and views rendered.</p>

<p>A good start is testing the show action in our Posts controller.</p>

<pre><code>class Posts &lt; Application
  provides :html

  def show(id)
    @post = Post[id]
    render @post

    rescue DataMapper::ObjectNotFoundError
    raise NotFound
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Our first test will ensure that Post[1] is called when /posts/1 is visited, and when the post exists the response code is 200 OK.</p>

<pre><code>describe Posts, "show action" do
  it "should find post and render show view" do
    Post.should_receive(:[]).with("1")
    get('/posts/1', :yields =&gt; :controller) do
      controller.stub!(:render)
    end
    status.should == 200
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The first should_receive ensures that Post[1] is called, we could mock out a Post instance to return here, but in this case we're only interested in it being called and not raising an exception.</p>

<p>Next we use the get method to make a request to the controller, the :yields option allows us to set what the get request returns. Here we want to grab the controller and then stub out the render method before the request is made. Anything inside you get method's block will be executed before the request is dispatched.</p>

<p>After the request has been dispatched, several methods are available to return the results from the request: body, status, params, cookies, headers, session, response and route. Note that these all just call the same method on controller (so status is the same as controller.status).</p>

<p>This test was fairly simple, and it's likely you won't need to such tests if your controllers are as simple as ours. But once you have more than a few lines in your controller, simple response status checks can be useful for ensuring the overall integrity of your app.</p>

<p>A more important test would be ensuring that a 404 is returned when the post cannot be found in the database. When Datamapper cannot find a record is raises Datamapper::ObjectNotFoundError. Merb has several useful exception classes which will set the correct status and then call the relevant action in your Exceptions controller. Raising NotFound will set the status to 404 and then call the not_found action, which can return a much nicer.</p>

<pre><code>it "should return 500 if post doesn't exist" do
  post = mock(Post)
  Post.should_receive(:[]).with("1").and_raise(DataMapper::ObjectNotFoundError)
  get('/posts/1')
  status.should == 404
end
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike the last test there was no need for us to stub the render method because DataMapper::ObjectNotFoundError is raised before it is reached.</p>

<h3>Testing multipart forms</h3>

<p>(TODO: Make and example of uploading assets in the simple blog)</p>

<p>The multipart_post method allows you to include files in a fake request. There must however be an actual file to be opened and submitted. If you put the file in the same directory as your spec, use File.dirname(<strong>FILE</strong>) to ensure the full path is used.</p>

<p>If you are going to open the tempfile which is uploaded, remember to stub out File.open. Watch out though, if you use simply open instead of File.open it won't be the File.open you stubbed out. The other issue here is within the spec we have no way of knowing what the filename of the tempfile is, so we have to assume it's correct and use an<em>instance</em>of(String) so any filename is accepted.</p>

<p>(TODO: test code)</p>

<pre><code>describe Posts, "create action" do 
    it "should receive file" do
      File.should_receive(:open).with(an_instance_of(String))
      multipart_post("/posts", {:image =&gt; File.open(File.join( File.dirname(__FILE__), "picture.jpg"))})
      controller.assigns(:filename).should == "picture.jpg"
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Your controller would look something like this.</p>

<pre><code>class Posts &lt; Application
    def create
        fp = File.open(params[:image][:tempfile].path)
        @filename = params[:image][:filename]
    end
end
</code></pre>

<h2>Changing the directory structure</h2>

<pre><code># Build the framework paths.
#
# By default, the following paths will be used:
# application:: Merb.root/app/controller/application.rb
# config:: Merb.root/config
# lib:: Merb.root/lib
# log:: Merb.root/log
# view:: Merb.root/app/views
# model:: Merb.root/app/models
# controller:: Merb.root/app/controllers
# helper:: Merb.root/app/helpers
# mailer:: Merb.root/app/mailers
# part:: Merb.root/app/parts
#
# To override the default, set Merb::Config[:framework] in your initialization file.
# Merb::Config[:framework] takes a Hash whose key is the name of the path, and whose
# values can be passed into Merb.push_path (see Merb.push_path for full details).
#
# ==== Note
# All paths will default to Merb.root, so you can get a flat-file structure by doing
# Merb::Config[:framework] = {}
# 
# ==== Example
# {{[
#   Merb::Config[:framework] = {
#     :view =&gt; Merb.root / "views"
#     :model =&gt; Merb.root / "models"
#     :lib =&gt; Merb.root / "lib"
#   }
# ]}}
# 
# That will set up a flat directory structure with the config files and controller files
# under Merb.root, but with models, views, and lib with their own folders off of Merb.root.
