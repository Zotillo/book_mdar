simple I-O-U tracker

Dependancies: merb, datamapper, DataObjects, do_sqlite3 

An example merb application, which uses sqlite3

It's a bit of a contrived example as accounts probably don't need to be a separate model but oh well.

TODO:
custom validation moved from controller to model for transaction creation
actually use the transactions in DM
convert some controllers to a part controller?
code for cancelling out i-owe-you's ie:
A owes B 3
B owes C 2
C owes A 1

would return

well in that case nobody owes anything

actually doing this hard maybe just sum up I-O-U's
