# simple_blog

As the name suggests it's a very simple blog.

Dependancies: merb, datamapper

TODO:
some sort of spam catcher, either a capatcha/akismet or could

"What is three plus ten?" would suffice. that and a comment block email list?

get 'inspiration' from the current merb/dm blogs MrBlog and blurb
might make a branch off blurb (when I learn git)
